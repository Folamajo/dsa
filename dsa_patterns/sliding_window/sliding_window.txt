sliding window allows us to focus on a subset of data by focusing the most relevant option at any given time

two types 
   -> Fixed sliding window , maintains constant length as it slides across the data structure commonly used if window length is known in advance 
   -> Dynamic window, expans and shrinks based on certain conditions

Use sliding window when:
   - working with array or strings
   - the problem involves contiguous elements
   - You need to optimize a brute-force approach(usually O(n^2))
